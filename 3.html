    It's like you got superpowers</a>
  Turn my minutes into hours
  You got more than 20-20, babe
  <strong>Made of <u>glass</u> the way you see through me</strong>
  You know me better than I do
  Can't seem to keep nothing from you
  How you touch my soul from the outside?
  Permeate my ego and my pride
  I wanna love me (ooh)
  The way that you love me (ooh)
  Ooh, for all of my pretty
  And all of my ugly too
  I'd love to see me from your point of view
  I wanna trust me (trust me)
  The way that you trust me (trust me)
  Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
  I'd love to see me from your point of view
  I'm gеtting used to receiving
  Still gеtting good at not leaving
  I'ma love you even though I'm scared (oh, scared)
  Learnin' to be grateful for myself (oh, oh, oh)
  You love my lips 'cause they say the
  Things we've always been afraid of
  I can feel it startin' to subside
  Learnin' to believe in what is mine
  I wanna love me (ooh)
  The way that you love me (ooh)
  Ooh, for all of my pretty
  And all of my ugly too
  I'd love to see me from your point of view
  I wanna trust me (trust me)
  The way that you trust me (trust me)
  Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
  I'd love to see me from your point of view
  I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
  Boy, I be impatient, but now I'm out here
  Fallin', fallin', frozen, slowly
  Fallin', got me right
  I won't keep you waitin' (waitin')
  All my baggage fadin' safely (my baggage fadin')
  And if my eyes deceive me
  Won't let them stray too far away, I
  I wanna love me (ooh)
  The way that you love me (ooh)
  Ooh, for all of my pretty
  And all of my ugly too
  I'd love to see me from your point of view
  I wanna trust me, ooh (trust me)
  The way that you trust me, baby (trust me)
  'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
  I'd love to see me from your point of view (oh)
  Yeah
